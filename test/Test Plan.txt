Test Plan for data verification

-- a simple start at testing the data integrity of the import script, import_cogcc.rb

Reports

-- simple listings of the 8 tables:
 
 companies            3466 
 counties               56 
 facilities          30084
 fields               1450
 fields_formations       0
 formations            437
 gastypes               10
 wells              143883


Commands to list data from tables:
-----------------------------------

select id,company_name from companies order by company_name;

select id,county_name from counties order by county_name;

select id, field_name, field_code from fields order by field_name;

select id, formation, formation_code from formations order by formation;

select id, gas_type from gastypes order by gas_type;

select id,facility_name,facility_num,latitude,latitude,company_id,county_id,field_id from facilities order by facility_name;

(do this in mysql before running next command: pager less)

select id,well_name,facility_id,gastype_id from wells order by well_name;
