June 2014:

Background: after some progress in connecting to Access and MySQL simultaneously in ruby,
ran into difficulties how to create foreign keys for records. Ran into Phil Battos at a
Boulder Ruby (Pivotal Labs) user group meeting June 17, who suggested using Rails to solve this.

That sounded like a good idea to me, and I started that direction....

Then at a Hacker Hours (Viget) user group meeting June 24, I showed my work to Patrick,
and he suggested reading the Access data into a CSV file using Ruby. Much to my surprise,
this worked! (which took all of 4 lines of code...see WriteCVS.rb)

Then I proceeded to build up the Rails models to write to the various tables needed in the
Wikifrack DB...but then ran into development environment problems building the native extensions
needed for Ruby to talk to MySQL...which took about a week to figure out.

The tables, or models, were initially created using the shell script, mkmodels.sh

As of tonight, can build the native extensions without error on my home Mac.

8-july

Went to Hacker Hours at Viget, spent most of time fixing errors in development environment on my Airbook.
Finally got that corrected (native extensions compiled). Got some help from Nathaniel, an intern there, who
showed me the Foreigner gem for handling creation of foreign keys during a CVS import.
Also suggested using seeds.rb...and the Atom editor from Github.

wfrails/lib/tasks/import_partial.rake
Have made progress on this Rake task that will populate the tables in the Wikifrac database. The greatest
difficulty is how to populate the foreign keys. Hove tried to take the project to Hacker Hours meetings at
the company Viget in Boulder, but have not been able to get my Ruby environment on my Airbook synched up
with the project on my home Mac (same error I had before on home Mac, error build native gems)

Having syntax errors in the task I don't understand...

9-sept-2014

Finally! Breakthrough...

I was very close to getting the import script (import_cogcc.rb) to work on my home machine, but was still encountering
a few nagging syntax errors using the CSV class for importing, which is now built into Ruby 2.0. I wanted to go to Hacker
Hours at Viget to see if I could get some help. But I was having trouble with my environment configuration on my Airbook, and
still had problems (building native extensions, of course...) but I went anyway. 

Patrick, leader of Viget Hacker Hours, helped me to solve the configuration problems (needed a correction on how shims were
being used in the homebrew configuration of Ruby, and in the path), then I corrected a slight error in the import script
(headers must be true, in the CSV statement that opens the csv file), and BOOM! The script worked!

Informed Shane later that night.

12-sept-2014

Got a phone call back from Shane on 9/10. Will be meeting him and the investor he says that will back Wikifrac today.

Am developing some reports that will test the data integrity of the import; but the data are importing, with these
results of record counts in the 8 tables:

 companies            3466 
 counties               56 
 facilities          30084
 fields               1450
 fields_formations       0
 formations            437
 gastypes               10
 wells              143883
