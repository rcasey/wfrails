Need: Develop queries that test the relationships (but what queries are needed?)

The Table counts: 
Facilities
Companies
Fields 
Counties
GasTypes
Wells
Formations

The Relationships:
Facilities -> Companies
Companies 
Fields 
Counties
GasTypes
Wells
Formations

Do the total number of wells equal the number of lines in the CSV import file?

    Almost: the import file (alldata_1.csv) has 143,884 input lines, the Wells table has 143,883 records.
    The script appears to have skipped the first record, for well named FEDERAL.

Does the Field_Formations table look correct?
    
    No: the field_formations table has zero records after the import; this is an error in the import script,
    since inspection of the CSV file shows that a Formation belongs to more than one Field.

Does the Formations table look correct?

    I think so; casual inspection of the Formation names all seem to have the correct Formation Code (when present)
